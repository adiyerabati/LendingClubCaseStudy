# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to identify high-risk loan applicants who are likely to default, thereby minimizing financial losses for a consumer finance company that provides various types of loans to urban customers.

---

## Challenges in Loan Approval
The company faces two types of risks in its loan approval process:
1. **Opportunity Loss**: Rejecting applicants who would have repaid their loans, resulting in missed profitability.
2. **Credit Loss**: Approving applicants who default on their loans, leading to financial setbacks.

## Loan Data Overview
The dataset contains the following outcomes for approved loans:
- **Fully Paid**: Loan repaid with interest.
- **Current**: Loan is still being repaid.
- **Charged-Off**: Loan defaulted, representing the primary source of loss.

**Note**: Rejected loans lack transaction history.

## Business Objective
The company aims to:
- Reduce credit losses by identifying risky borrowers.
- Take appropriate actions such as:
  - Denying loans to high-risk applicants.
  - Reducing loan amounts.
  - Charging higher interest rates for high-risk applicants.

## Analysis Approach
Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, this project will:
- Present results in a well-commented Python file.
- Include visualizations to enhance understanding.
- Highlight key findings from:
  - **Univariate Analysis**: Analysis of individual features.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**: Analysis of relationships between features.

## Conclusion (Suggestions)
To enhance the loan approval process and minimize risk, the following suggestions are proposed:

1. **Risk Assessment Framework**:
   - Implement a robust framework that considers multiple factors, such as:
     - Income.
     - Debt-to-income ratio.
     - Credit history.
     - Loan purpose.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - Extend the analysis to include:
     - Borrower demographics (e.g., age, income, occupation).
     - Loan purpose.
     - Creditworthiness metrics (e.g., credit score, debt-to-income ratio).
     - Economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, unemployment rates).

3. **Trend Monitoring**:
   - Anticipate peak default periods and develop strategies to mitigate risks during these times.

4. **Interest Rate Adjustments**:
   - Monitor and dynamically adjust interest rates to balance risk and profitability.

5. **Loan Term Evaluation**:
   - Pay particular attention to customers who take loans for 60 months, as they are more prone to default.

6. **Income-Based Decision Making**:
   - Consider income levels and economic stability as critical factors in loan approval decisions.

By adopting these measures, the company can significantly reduce credit losses and optimize its loan portfolio management.
